Venus in Gemini
In matters of love and romance, a person's sense of humor, intellect, and communication skills attract you more than their physical appearance. You desire a partner who is mentally stimulating, curious, one who can challenge your mind, and keeps you from getting bored. Relationships where talking, sharing ideas, going places, and learning new things together are highly preferred and needed. You need a lot of social stimulation and can be a bit of a flirt. Jealous and possessive partners turn you off. You are charming, friendly, and enjoy meeting new people. You can be fickle in matters of love and may have a tendency to desire more than one love interest at a time. You enjoy the fun and excitement of love, yet may fear its obligations. Your feelings can be well expressed through speaking, through writing or poetry, or perhaps through art where you get a chance to work with your hands. Your emotions are ruled by your mind and you may prefer intellectualizing your feelings. If Venus if poorly aspected, your breathing may be shallow and there may be poor oxygenation of the blood.

Saturn in Gemini
Your thinking is deliberate and serious and you possess organization skills, concentration and mental stability. You can focus on deep and difficult matters and come up with practical solutions to problems. You enjoy learning. But there may also be tendencies towards cynicism, depression, and pessimism. Nervous tension can be a problem and the intake of air into the lungs or the oxygenation of the blood can be restricted. Your lungs need plenty of oxygen. It is best for you to sleep in a well-ventilated room. Saturn here steadies your mind and helps control the natural flightiness of Gemini. This is a good position for Saturn, but you may need to develop faith in the future. It will be important for you to discipline your mind and learn to think and act methodically if you are to be successful in anything.

Chiron in Gemini
With Chiron in this sign, you might be hypersensitive to how others receive your words and questions. You might feel rejected when you contribute to a conversation or write out and share your thoughts, as others seem not to understand you or, perhaps, outright judge or reject what you say. Your ideas might flow with a stream-of-consciousness feel so that you move quickly from one idea to the next, potentially confusing others who are not sure what part of what you’re saying they should latch onto. It’s not true that your voice isn’t valid, but it might jump around so much that others simply don’t know how to engage with you and take you seriously. When you accept the unique nature of how your mind and mental processing works, you will find the confidence to trust what you’re thinking while letting it flow. You have a unique ability to adapt to the ways that others’ minds work, yet make sure you don’t adapt to their (seemingly acceptable) rhythms at the expense of your own. You can use your Chironic sensitivity in communication by learning to meet someone where he or she is, and you’ll see you have a unique ability to make logical connections in the thoughts and words of others that can help them progress along their way. You’re wonderfully sensitive to the subtleties of language and meaning, and it’s your job – and on one else’s – to validate the way you hear, process/think, speak and write. When you’re comfortable accepting your unique mind and voice, you’ll find they have unique abilities to cut through small talk and get to the heart of any issue.

Lilith in Gemini
If you have Lilith in Gemini, some of your most important personal trials will be in your way of communicating and relating with others. Your methods of communication may be the definitive test for the full manifestation of your qualities. You must take full advantage of your intelligence and sensitivity, because otherwise you can fall into being a provocateur.
As Mercury is the planet of eloquence, whoever has Lilith in Gemini will seek to captivate their “prey” by means of words. Instead of innocently picking up a date, they tend to seduce a partner to satisfy their personal pride.
Men, especially, are prone to acting like a “Don Juan.” They can partner up just to prance around with their “trophy.” Once they achieve their prize, they go in search of more and more, without giving much consideration to the havoc that they may cause. Sex can become their only objective, using their mental sharpness to reach the desired end. Then, they will be a prime example of a lack of ethics: they will promise what they know they will not fulfill.
In women this feature is toned down because they are more calculating. They look for alliances with material ends. It is not easy to conquer a woman with Black Moon Lilith in Gemini. And if she were to have a lover, nobody would ever know.
Both men and women can be superficial in love. They care more about appearances than anything else. But, if someone with Lilith in Gemini really falls in love, they can lose their mind.
For your Black Moon in Gemini to work well:
Try to be yourself in the way you communicate. Decide if you want to use your communication ability to support your personal relationships, or to show off your intelligence like an immature youth.

Node in Gemini
A tendency to hold beliefs and opinions without gathering the facts, to being self-righteous and running roughshod over others’ feelings, to rushing through life and possessing excess nervous energy, and to lack tact in our relationships with others are some of the issues this position suggests. With this position, we easily crack under imagined pressures, and we are too often in a hurry for fear that our freedom will be curtailed if we stop long enough to gather facts and consider the details of everyday life. We need to learn to listen to others so that we discover the value of true communication and exchange, and to see both sides of a situation instead of throwing out dogma at others. We want to have meaningful and intelligent exchanges with others, and we want to teach others as well. But in order for us to succeed with these things, we need to learn that true learning and exchanges can only come when we listen to others. Learning to slow down, to be sensitive to social graces and networks, and to sensitize ourselves to others’ needs and communications without fear of being tied down, will release us from some of our nervous tension and help us achieve more happiness and inner balance.

Part of Fortune in Gemini

Vertex in Gemini
You are expected to bring your ability to communicate or write to the fore, and to use hard-core facts to clarify situations. People expect you to come up with ideas and present them clearly, speak, write, or instruct, debate your own view point, and gain a position as a spokesperson.
Doing these things may improve your ability to get your ideas across to others because you learn to choose your words carefully and have the facts to back them up. You also gain the confidence to speak out because you have developed communication skills and maintained a youthful curiosity. In short, you are well prepared with facts when tested.
Not developing these skills allows you to generalize or go off on a tangent, losing the point you are trying to make. You may avoid research and fail to achieve mental flexibility and clarity, or you may get hung up on a single goal instead of developing the diversity you need.

Mars in Gemini
Mentally and physically you are the busy, little bee. You are constantly in motion with many and various activities, usually several at a time. You are happiest when busy and you hate boredom. Your mind is alert, active, and constantly seeking to learn more. You absorb knowledge like a sponge and you will debate and argue with anyone who wants a mental sparring match. A great deal of nervous tension or anxiety can exist with this position and it is important that you get regular exercise to relieve the stress. You talk with your hands and may be ambidextrous or have mechanical ability. There is a need to think before acting and to have patience so that you keep yourself out of trouble. Sometimes you just do things for the sake of doing something and this is not always a good idea. Look before you leap. Travel appeals to you because you never know what you might learn or who you might meet. Burns or accidents can occur to the shoulders or arms, probably due to haste. You can accomplish a lot in short bursts, but projects that require long-term commitment, stamina, and steady, persistent effort are not easy for you. You often scatter your energies into so many directions and activities at once that you cannot finish or follow through on some of them. You need variety, change, and mental challenges. Your mind is sharp and you enjoy mental challenges, games, or competitions. Matching wits with someone else really brings out the competitor in you. Your drive and energy is more mental than physical. You use your wit, intelligence, communication skills, social sophistication, and awareness to achieve your goals. Sarcasm and humor come easy to you. You need to learn how to conserve energy so you don't burn out and concentration so you will complete projects and carry through on promises.

Mercury in Gemini
You have an extremely adaptable, energetic, active, alert, curious, and versatile mind. You seek knowledge, either through reading or conversation, or through travel and talking with the new people you constantly meet. You have so much nervous energy that this can sometimes cause great stress which must find an appropriate release. Exercise is a good way to release this tension. You are clever, witty, and always have a joke or comeback ready for any situation. You love being involved in multiple things at once and this may be a problem too may irons in the fire at the same time. You are quick to grasp new concepts and equally quick to lose interest in an idea or project once your curiosity has been satisfied. You like to taste a little bit of everything concentration and disciplined study are not your strong points. You are handy with your hands and may be ambidextrous or mechanically inclined. Debate and argument appeal to you. There is a tendency to scratch the surface with the things that strike your interest without learning anything very deeply. This is the jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none position. There is danger, then, of superficiality. Control of thought, word, and action is necessary in order to be successful. Find your focus, stay with it and develop perseverance. Journalism, speaking, teaching, sales, advertising, or writing may appeal to you. Mentally restless, you may change jobs or locations frequently, or do work that involves movement, travel, and variety. You grasp concepts easily and may become impatient with those who don't learn as quickly.

Sun in Gemini
Geminians are friendly, clever, talkative, versatile, curious, perceptive, intuitive, and logical. At times they can also be quite contradictory, restless, two-faced, critical, and impatient. Gemini people enjoy and need work that includes a great deal of variety. They love to do several things all at the same time, sometimes making them late for appointments. They abhor boredom.

Geminians tend to flit from one experience to another, gathering in all types of information along the way, but seldom getting to the depth of any subject. They go broad and not deep. Persistence is not their strong suit. Gaining knowledge and disseminating it is their real talent. Hence, they make wonderful salespeople or teachers if they stick around long enough to get all the facts instead of only half the story. Even if they do not possess all the facts, since they are never at a loss for words, they will continue with their story as if they did have all the facts.

It is important for a Geminian to seek intellectual satisfaction. Mental stagnation turns them off, so they read extensively and communicate widely in order to satisfy this longing for mental stimulation. This discontent can make them either very ambitious, or it can incline them to jump from one thing to another, searching for the greener grass which never appears.

Geminians usually think quickly on their feet and have the ability to use the right words in any situation. They possess tremendous wit and a good sense of humor. Other people may have difficulty in keeping up with their rapid change of subjects.

Because Geminians think so quickly, they often finish other people's sentences for them. This can be most frustrating for the person trying to express their own thoughts. There is a need to learn how to control the tongue and allow slower people to express their own opinions and ideas.

Since Geminians have the capacity to see both sides of any issue, they may fluctuate back and forth between opposing viewpoints. They will usually tend to side with the opinion of whomever they happen to be with at the moment. Then they change as the circumstances change. Indecisiveness is a problem for Geminians.

Geminians are usually emotionally detached. They use their minds rather than their hearts to find their way through things. Logic and reason are their guidelines. They are able to understand what makes other people behave as they do, but they have difficulty in projecting themselves into the emotional reactions of the person involved.

Some of the negative traits that Geminians possess are lack of concentration and focus, undependability, fickleness, indecisiveness, superficiality, wishful thinking, and dreaminess. They can also be pretty good at nagging.

Geminians need to work on getting their mind under control. Their nervous system is highly strung. If they don't learn to control their nerves, they are apt to become ill. The way out of this difficulty is to take the emphasis off themselves and lose it through service to others. Above all, the Geminian needs to learn to channel (control) his energy and his mind.
