Chiron in Leo
With Chiron in the sign of self-expression, play, and creativity, you might feel hypersensitive to the reactions of others when you improvise and play. If you tell a joke and someone else doesn’t get it or thinks it’s not funny, you might feel the Chironic wound activated and edit yourself later, perhaps for the rest of your life. Remember that you’re prone to taking the reactions of others to your unique voice too seriously, making too much of them as if someone thinking your joke isn’t funny means that you in general are not funny and shouldn’t tell jokes. The truth is that your playful, humorous side is always shaped by your awareness of energy and emotion, and so your humor might tap cause others to be aware of their own insecurities, bringing them try to defend against your playful side by putting it down or ignoring it. Your job with this placement is to validate your own playful side, not waiting for anyone else to do it and not defining yourself in terms of others’ reactions to you. As this can affect the health of your ego, making sure that you accept your own vulnerabilities and insecurities with compassionate awareness – refusing to judge that sometimes you have fear about owning and showing who you are – can help you fully inhabit your unique self and not try to change for others in order to more liked and accepted.

Lilith in Leo
With Lilith in Leo, you must learn where your creative abilities and your core essence reside. If you do not discover your true self, you may feel driven to seek attention or social recognition, or to act out exaggerated shows in order to make yourself noticed. The personality you express must be authentically yours, and not forced.
If you have Black Moon Lilith in Leo, your love is centered on yourself. Psychologists call it narcissism. Both men and women seek to be honored for their beauty and physical appearance. You can cause disappointments by taking advantage of your partner and by not recognizing your sexual-emotional mistakes.
There is a tendency to lie. If you become unfaithful, you will, out of pride, play the misunderstood victim when you know inwardly that you betrayed your partner.
The repressed sexual impulses focus on “I want.” You may have unspoken internal conflicts. These can overflow and cause you to exercise power and dominion over your partner or children “just because” or, as Aesop said, “because I am the Lion.”
For your Black Moon in Leo to work well:
Look for your own identity, without falling into the world of appearances. Focus your fire on what your passions really are. Do not look so much for recognition from others.

Node in Leo
A tendency to rely on others who may let us down, to come across as impersonal or distant in our dealings with others, to be fearful of being the center of attention and standing out as an individual, to fear taking risks, and to fall back on peers and community at the expense of our own individuality are some of the issues this position suggests. With this position, we need to avoid falling into the easy trap of worrying about what others think about us. Instead, we need to strike out in our own individual and creative path without fear. We need to make a conscious effort to deal with others in a more personal, involved, and loving manner, rather than falling back on reason and intellect which detaches us from our feelings. We can easily alienate others when we over-emphasize equality to the point that we won’t acknowledge individuals’ uniqueness. We can too easily lose touch with our own heart by rationalizing our feelings, and become overly involved with other people’s problems at the expense of our inner needs for attention. Learning to take personal risks, which requires a certain amount of self-confidence, will help us to achieve inner balance and happiness.

Sun in Leo
Leos are dignified, courageous, affectionate, powerful, generous, playful, optimistic, ambitious, loyal, and cheerful. On the negative side, though, they can be quite demanding, intolerant, domineering, lazy, closed-minded, and self-centered. They choose to do things that give them wide scope for creativity, organizing, and leadership. Although appearing strong on the outside, most Leos are inwardly sensitive and their feelings are easily hurt. When this occurs, they can turn on the object of their affection, when their pride is hurt.

Leos have a decided flair for the dramatic and they enjoy telling stories, being the center of attention, having a good time, and running the show. Mean and cruel acts are generally beneath them, but they do not hesitate to use force when needed. No matter what their actions, they always have the belief that whatever they do is for the other person's benefit.

If a Leo is angered, he immediately goes into his kingly role, "mounting his throne" and quickly putting the opposition or challenger in their proper place. Leos literally roar at people when they are angry. But once their tirade is over, they forgive and forget and never hold a grudge.

At their best, Leos are affectionate, cheerful, optimistic people who can be counted on to bring sunshine into other people's lives. They are exceptionally generous. Money appears to slip through their fingers as if it were grains of sand. And, like the sand, they have no idea where it has gone.

Leos usually have vitality and good health, with strong recuperative powers. When they are ill, they have a tendency to run high fevers. They are seldom depressed, but when they are, they are devastated. Fortunately, their resilient powers are excellent, so they are soon sunny and happy again, unless their heart has been broken. That is the one thing a Leo has difficulty in overcoming. This can actually lead to physical troubles with their own heart.

Leos need to admire their marriage partner. If they don't, the marriage may not last very long. In the end, Leos need to feel appreciated.
