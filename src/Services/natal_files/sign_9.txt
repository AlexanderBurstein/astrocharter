You may have poor circulation in the hips and legs. You need physical exercise and fresh air, especially in your sleeping quarters.

Chiron in Sagittarius
Chiron in the sign of expansion and adventure might have you afraid to risk thinking and imaging big things for yourself. Throughout your life you’ve been hypersensitive to how others react to your big ideas and imagination, and even your beliefs, at times feeling rejected because others don’t get them or feel they’re not worth anything. As Sagittarius relates to the flow of imagination, when ideas pass through your right brain and may or may not find something real to root into and take shape, with Chiron in this sign you could resist letting your mind travel to far-off places in creative modes. The way you come up with new ideas, as well as how you approach optimism and developing faith that tomorrow can be better than today, is infused with an awareness of human energy and emotion. If others don’t get you and you take that to mean that your ideas aren’t worth expressing, then you’re at risk of believing that you yourself are not worth acceptance and love. This can take you into pessimism as your belief system, which doesn’t need to define who you are. Accept that your beliefs and big ideas may trigger the sensitivities of others and stop taking their reactions to you as indicative of what you’re worth, and you’ll open the door to expressing your unique viewpoints and helping others tap into their own unique perspectives.

Lilith in Sagittarius
Your test may be abroad in a foreign land. You should learn how to combine your wildest or most adventurous side with your more accommodating and conservative side. If your Black Moon works well, you will be attracted to the development of your intellect and spirituality. Otherwise, you could fall into superstition or become a “player” with a love of the game.
Black Moon Lilith in Sagittarius mixes money with love. Anyone who has Lilith in Sagittarius can invest money to get emotional benefits. “Paying for love” in this way can lead to ruin. People with Lilith in Sagittarius are usually involved in legal proceedings, or being slandered for sexual reasons, or enduring revenge for infidelities.
Perhaps you may practice adultery because you are not exactly contained sexually. Your love for novelty can induce you to infidelity in the most blatant way, but with the false sense that you are innocent. You can live with your two lovers under one roof, maintain two homes at the same time, or even set up group relationships. You can also find yourself in ambiguous situations, such as falling in love with your best friend’s spouse. For you, “all is fair in love and war.”
For your Black Moon in Sagittarius to work well:
Think about what adventures you need to live out in order for you to experience fullness or break out of your current boundaries. Avoid falling into major social nonconformity.

Node in Sagittarius
A tendency to be overwhelmed by information overload, to be mentally over-stimulated to the point of not being able to make effective decisions, to be bound by logic and swamped in details at the expense of our intuition, and to miss the “big picture” are some of the issues this position suggests. With this position, it can be difficult to commit ourselves to any one thing. We need to learn to trust our inner guide our intuition in order to uncover more meaning to our lives. Our decisions tend to lead us astray, as we rely too heavily on logic and miss out on the exciting adventures generated from the thrill and satisfaction of following a hunch or a vision. We need to allow ourselves to believe in something that doesn’t necessarily make sense, but that frees us from mental anxiety and stress. When we don’t commit ourselves to something, we run the risk of appearing superficial or flighty to others. Worst of all, the passion of true discovery eludes us, and we cannot feel whole or satisfied. When we don’t have the faith to know who we are and what we believe, even without knowing, we will never come across as sincere or truthful. We cannot inspire others to have faith in us when we do not have faith in ourselves. When we act bravely and impulsively, working on intuition and faith, we free ourselves from the inner turmoil of doubt and too much logic, and find an inner balance that enriches our lives and our souls.

Vertex in Sagittarius
You are expected to develop broad vision and a deeper understanding of the significance behind the facts. You may develop a new religious awareness or a philosophical view of things. You could become inspired by reaching toward higher truth. You may travel or attain a higher education, deal with legal principles, teach a class dealing with religion or philosophy, and editorialize, promote, or bring understanding to difficult situations.
Doing these things may teach you to have faith in yourself, your abilities, and your goals in life. You will learn that faith in yourself must come from faith in something outside the self.
Not accomplishing your goals may incline you to accept a law or principle without looking past the facts to see how it will actually affect people. You will find it difficult to accept the accolades and rewards you have earned and, instead, drift aimlessly through life.

Sun in Sagittarius
Sagittarians tend to be idealistic, optimistic, dependable, open-minded, friendly, honest and versatile. But, they can also be tactless, irresponsible, showy, boastful, self-righteous, arrogant, quarrelsome, fanatical, dogmatic and dictatorial. Sagittarians like any work where foresight and a willingness to take a chance is offered, while at the same time, they try to avoid detailed work.

Sagittarians are usually outspoken, sometimes to the point of bluntness. Simply blurting out their ideas and opinions is due to their never-ending search for truth and wisdom. Others think Sagittarians are pretty tactless and the statement that "truth hurts" fits their way of thinking. Regardless of their undiplomatic remarks, others instinctively feel as if the Sagittarian means them no real harm and is only interested in raising their consciousness.

Sagittarians love the outdoors, large animals, nature and sports. Some have reckless gambling tendencies and will bet it all on the drop of a hat. Travel and even long walks appeal to them because they make the Sagittarian feel free and he needs to feel free.

Sagittarians are philosophical and they want to understand the deeper issues and abstractions of life. They have a certain faith in higher things that generally always keeps them of an optimistic bent, no matter what difficulties are currently besetting them. They want to understand the meaning of life. This helps to keep them growing and expanding, which is something they need to do. This desire for expansion can cause them to overextend themselves with too many activities and to use up their energy too rapidly. They need to take intervals of rest to recuperate between projects.

Sagittarians need to learn how to concentrate on their current projects and stick with them to the end. Always full of enthusiasm, they tend to show it more at the start of new endeavors, then it tends to lessen as the project goes along and gets stuck in details, or the going gets a little rough, or it simply gets a little boring.

Although Sagittarians are ordinarily healthy, they can run into trouble due to overindulgence in food and drink.

Sagittarians are known for their friendliness, helpfulness and subtle humor. They are good conversationalists and enjoy debating merely for the sake of debating. They have a real gift for making friends and the typical Sagittarian can go anywhere in the world without ever feeling lonely, for they acquire friends along the route. They have humanitarian instincts and are practical in expressing them. They will tend to help anyone who is in need. You can usually depend on their loyalty and honesty, for there is nothing devious or manipulative in their nature.

Sagittarians are extremely independent and restless, with a real need for personal freedom. They can experience claustrophobia, either physical or emotional. This is why they are reluctant to get into total commitment situations and often shy away from marriage. In love, Sagittarians are highly romantic, but they need their partner to be intelligent and communicative. They hate jealousy and possessiveness on the part of their partner, especially since they are fond of flirting. They enjoy the chase more than the capture.

Careerwise, Sagittarians are reluctant to become tied down to a set schedule, so will experiment with a variety of jobs. They do best in careers that permit them to travel about, either locally or widely. They also like dealing directly with people, either selling or promoting ideas, products, etc.

The Sagittarian may overlook small details, but their overall sense of planning is excellent. They have good memories. The challenge of a problem is what interests them, for it caters to their enjoyment in exploring the unknown. Playing games comes easily to a Sagittarian and it is the journey they enjoy rather than the destination.
